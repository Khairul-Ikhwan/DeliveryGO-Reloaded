# Project Title: DeliveryGO Reloaded

## Introduction

DeliveryGO Reloaded is a project designed to streamline the process of tracking jobs in growing Telegram groups, specifically those centered around delivery services such as t.me/SGPARCELS. As the volume of messages increases, it becomes increasingly challenging to keep track of job postings. DeliveryGO Reloaded offers an efficient and organized system for job tracking, providing a solution to this problem. This project is an iteration of an earlier project completed as part of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive course, drawing inspiration from courier services such as Lalamove and NinjaVan.

## Features

1. **User Authentication (Login and Sign-Up):** DeliveryGO Reloaded provides a secure login and sign-up process for new and existing users, ensuring that user data is protected.

2. **Job Tracking System:** The platform offers an organized system for tracking job postings from the Telegram group, making it easier for users to keep track of available jobs and their details.

3. **Filters for Easy Browsing:** Users can filter jobs by category, allowing them to find jobs that match their skills and preferences quickly and easily.

4. **Job Posting System:** The platform provides a straightforward interface for job posting, making it easy for users to post new jobs and provide all the necessary details.

5. **Distance and Pricing Calculator:** A distance and pricing calculator is included to ensure fair charges for both users and drivers. This feature takes into account the distance of the delivery and calculates a fair price accordingly.

6. **Account Control and Profile Settings:** Users have control over their account settings, including the ability to update passwords and phone numbers. DeliveryGO Reloaded prioritizes the security and convenience of user accounts, ensuring that users can easily manage their account details.
